# IDT
A web application that maps IP address to Global location on Map, with an feature to send a SMS to a particular user using Amazon SNS Service.

Setup Guide:

Must have node package manager installed on your device.

1) Run "npm install" to install all the dependencies
2) Run "npm start" to start the application
3) Goto "localhost:3000/" to start the application

Gulp setup

-> Gulp is working, but I am not using the resources obtained after the gulp build depending on the situation.

AWS Configuration

-> Data>message.js has a configuration variable, to manipulate the behaviour of the SMS
- Change the region and country code to send sms to a different global region

Future work
-> Migrating the front end to more rigorous framework such as React.
